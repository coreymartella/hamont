                <h2>Protests in Ferguson</h2>
				<p class="date">26 Sep 2014</p>
                <p>A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> looked at Twitter&#39;s relationship to the protests over the death of a black teen, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. While the happenings in Ferguson are heartbreaking, to say the least, the purpose of this post is to compare some of the points raised in the <em>New York Times</em> article with Hamilton&#39;s Twitter activism community.</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> article refers to a counterpublic commonly referred to amongst its users as &quot;Black Twitter&quot; and cites the PEW Internet Project&#39;s study of <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/06/african-americans-and-technology-use/">African Americans and Technology Use</a>. According to the PEW study, &quot;22% of online blacks are Twitter users, compared with 16% of online whites.&quot; and, further to that point, &quot;Younger African Americans in particular have especially high rates of Twitter use. Fully 40% of 18-29 year old African Americans who use the internet say that they use Twitter. That is 12 percentage points higher than the comparable figure for young whites (28% of whom are Twitter users).&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to compare these statistics to the survey findings from the <em>#HamOnt</em> research project, which shows an overwhelming majority of the respondents were white (94.3%). When looking at Hamilton&#39;s demographics, only 13.6% of the population (according to the city&#39;s 2010 <a href="http://www.hamilton.ca/NR/rdonlyres/D7646C20-EA23-42FA-9452-1ECA22E8ED9C/0/HSP_TechReport_3.pdf"><em>TECHNICAL REPORT #3 for The Playbook: A Framework for Human Services Planning in Hamilton</em></a> identify as a visible minority. From that group, roughly 20% identify as Black, which counts for a mere 3% of the total population of Hamilton.</p>

<p>In a city where the population is predominantly white, it seems logical that Twitter&#39;s <em>#HamOnt</em> population would be largely white as well, but what seems odd is that Twitter&#39;s overall popularity among Black Internet users doesn&#39;t result in larger representation among visible minorities in the survey findings. That said, the <em>#HamOnt</em> survey was conducted using a snowball sampling, which may not be entirely representative of the city&#39;s population.</p>

<p>Another point, that struck me as interesting from the <em>New York Times</em> piece was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yemisi Miller-Tonnet, 19, a student at Spelman College in Atlanta, said social media movements should be taken seriously. “Hashtag activism is activism,” Ms. Miller-Tonnet said. “We might be tweeting from a couch, but we’re also getting up and doing the work that needs to be done.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Hashtag activism&quot;, or as referenced in the <em>#HamOnt</em> research, slacktivism, is clearly an effective means of garnering support from those that may not be fully aware of the problem in the first place. Hashtags, such as #IfTheyGunnedMeDown and #HandsUpDontShoot were used to show support for the people of Ferguson, as well as build awareness for the cause and the greater injustices that stemmed from Brown&#39;s death.</p>

<p>Both hashtags use imagery to help spread the messages associated with the protests. #IfTheyGunnedMeDown shows two juxtaposed portraits of black youth; one image depicts the individual as a fine upstanding citizen, the other plays on stereotypes to suggest they are less than civil. The #HandsUpDontShoot hashtag carries with it images of supporters with their hands in the air, surrendering, as Brown was doing when he was shot by police. The <em>New York Times</em> claims that the #IfTheyGunnedMeDown hashtag has been used over 168,000 times since the campaign began, making its reach exponentially larger.</p>

<p>Both these hashtag protests express emotion and help sway opinion for the cause. Both sets of images clearly define the undercurrents that fuel the protestors in Ferguson and bring needed attention from around the world to the injustices faced by these protestors as they continue to stand up for what they believe in.</p>

		<!-- <p class="date">26 Sep 2014</p> -->    
		<p>The PEW Internet Research group recently conducted a survey seeking "people’s opinions about the Snowden leaks, their willingness to talk about the revelations in various in-person and online settings, and their perceptions of the views of those around them in a variety of online and off-line contexts."

		<!-- <p class="date">26 Sep 2014</p> -->    
		<p>When a video of freelance photojournalist James Foley being beheaded by members of ISIS was released online, social media sites, like Twitter and YouTube, worked to remove the images and videos linked on their sites. Twitter representatives state that they removed the imagery on the request of Foley's family, as per their current policies. This is a fair request from the family, but as journalist Mathew Ingram points out: "... as well-meaning as their [Twitter & Youtube] behavior might be, do we really want those platforms to be the ones deciding what content we can see or not see?"
