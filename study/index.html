                        <p>Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, has been called "the ambitious city", but it now struggles to recover from the faltering of the steel industry that determined its growth during the better part of the twentieth century. Recently, a niche group of net-savvy, civic-minded, and engaged Hamiltonians composed of longtime residents, along with an influx of Greater Toronto Area expatriates, has been endeavouring to improve the city's outdated infrastructure by campaigning for a better place to live: creating cycling lanes throughout the city, adding light rail to the public transportation system, and keeping casinos out of the core.</p>

<p>Twitter has become a tool for civic engagement and political change in Hamilton, making it easier for people to “organize, mobilize and engage” <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. The one-to-many style of communication makes it an ideal soapbox for activists to get their messages out and rally support from the public <a class="ptr">[1]</a> <a class="ptr">[6]</a> <a class="ptr">[7]</a> <a class="ptr">[11]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a> and makes it easier to spread information to others taking up the cause <a class="ptr">[2]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a>. On the surface, Twitter provides an opportunity for horizontality within a movement by removing the necessity to disclose age, gender, or race, ultimately providing the opportunity for everyone to participate <a class="ptr">[9]</a> <a class="ptr">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Given these characteristics, some scholars have argued that Twitter is a networked form of Habermas's public sphere, <a class="ptr">[10]</a> _a body of 'private persons' assembled to discuss matters of 'public concern'_ <a class="ptr">[4]</a>. In the context of Hamilton, Twitter has the potential to give engaged citizens a public forum in which they can discuss and debate in political discourse as democratic equals; however, there are also significant limitations to this potential. </p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 01</i>Councillor Sam Merulla was one of the first users to respond to the Twitter thread stemming from the Dialogue Partners' misstep.</span>In Habermas's definition of the public sphere, "A body of 'private persons'" suggests a distinct separation of society and state, yet some of the strongest voices on Twitter are members of Hamilton's city council. [footnote 01]  It can be argued that these members of state are indeed, also citizens of Hamilton, but they most certainly possess significant political influence. For some, this fact alone may disprove the notion that Twitter in Hamilton is a networked public sphere.</p>

<p>Members of the public sphere <em>assemble</em> to discuss. The notion of assembly implies that there is open access to the forum in question. This brings into focus the "digital divide", and the ability of any and all interested parties to access the Internet and engage on Twitter. As will be discussed later in this paper, Hamilton has a deep digital divide, suggesting that open access to assembly does not (and possibly cannot) exist.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 02</i>Locke Street and James Street North are both recognized as newly gentrified neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods also have the highest number of survey respondents. James Street overlaps the Cannon Street cycle path, and Locke Street falls is situated close to the terminus of an extension of the bike lane being constructed using funds from Ward one's participatory budget.</span>Habermas argues that <em>matters of public concern</em> are to be discussed in the public sphere, and that interests solely benefiting the individual are to be left out of the arena <a class="ptr">[4]</a>. Advocates for the initiatives that are detailed as case studies in this research believe they are discussing matters that concern the greater good of the community; however, critics charge that a net-savvy elite is simply trying to gentrify the city. [footnote 02] </p>

<p>Regardless of whether Twitter creates a true networked public sphere, protesters and activists who come together online share a set of common beliefs and values that over time can end up forming a community; interviewees for this research speak to how their involvement in several movements helped introduce them to their communities and form friendships through Twitter.</p>

<p>The role of Twitter in large-scale movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Springs has been studied at length by researchers, but Hamilton represents a different sort of case. Civic engagement in Hamilton is focused on local issues instead of on toppling governments or revolutionizing the world. Hamilton's Twitter crowd uses the social media platform to help inform its citizenry and effect infrastructure change within the city. While it is true that Hamiltonians may use Twitter for organizing rallies and protests, they do not do so on the same scale or for the same reasons as those involved in the 2011 Arab Springs in the Middle East. In an authoritarian state like Egypt, there was a very clear and present danger, and success relied on the number of bodies marching in the street, not just the number of retweets <a class="ptr">[5]</a>. In Hamilton, physical participation is often less than impressive; a bike parade down Cannon Street in support of the proposed bike lanes saw a turnout of just a few dozen supporters, yet the campaign was successful, despite the lack of physical representation. Critics of Twitter's role in protests and politics refer to this form of social media activism as "slacktivism." This research suggests that that slacktivism may, in fact, be an effective way to create change in a democratic municipality like Hamilton.</p>

<p>Another reason Hamiltonians may be successful in informing political decisions is because of the relatively easy access to politicians in the city. Most members of council have a Twitter account and several are very active on the social media platform. Councillor Sam Merulla observes that "[Twitter] basically equalizes the playing field, not only for the residents, who now gain instant access to politicians, where, in the past, that was never the case... It really is changing the landscape of politics. and it's changed because the demand from the community has literally been born. Without that demand, you wouldn't receive the response." <a class="ptr">[8]</a> These differences from large-scale movements like the Arab Springs and Occupy Wall Street make studying Twitter’s relationship to civic engagement in Hamilton an important step to better understanding how it facilitates change and fosters community within smaller populations and geographic regions.</p>

<p>This research project began with a survey which asked Hamilton's Twitter users to answer a set of questions concerning media, politics, community, and, of course, Twitter. The findings of the project were then used to inform a series of interviews with  three activists and one city councillor who are prominent in Hamilton's political Twitter scene. Together, the quantified data and the anecdotal responses of the interviews paints a clear picture of how Twitter has impacted some of the biggest issues affecting Hamilton's politics and communities. Two particular case studies were used to discuss the survey findings: <em>Yes We Cannon</em> and the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em>. These case studies were selected for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both cases are recent, taking place in 2013.</li>
<li>Both cases have effectively seen a conclusion.</li>
<li>In both cases, the citizens in the case study were successful in achieving their goals.</li>
<li>The cases are quite different from each other: whereas one started spontaneously, and took place over a matter of days, the other was created by a trio of organizers and spanned several months before reaching completion.</li>
</ol>

<p>Several key themes emerged in this research: the very strong divide between the "haves" and "have-nots" in Hamilton's Twittersphere, the group’s strong sense of community, which can also extend offline, and the effectiveness of social media in achieving their goals, even if their efforts may seem like “slacktivism.” This paper looks at how civic engagement is affected by Twitter and, in particular, how slacktivism can promote and effect change. This discussion is followed by an analysis of who is involved in this discourse and what significance that holds for the city of Hamilton as a whole. Finally, this paper explores how Twitter users see their community and how they are effecting change within it.</p>

<p><a class="button expand" href="/study/methodologies">Continue reading: Methodologies</a></p>

                    
                 
                    
                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="methodologies" id="methodologies">Methodologies</h2>
                        <p>The research discussed in this paper draws from a combination of an online survey and series of open-ended interviews. The online survey was distributed via Twitter to gather information from users within the city of Hamilton. Distribution through Twitter provides two key benefits: 1) the population I am interested in is readily found on Twitter, and 2) the data was collected electronically, making it easier to analyze. </p>

<p>I conducted an online survey, obtaining participation via Twitter. I posted tweets from my personal Twitter account, which I have maintained since 2008. This is a significant detail for two reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>Over the past several years I have followed dozens of Hamiltonians, mainly because of their interest in local politics and because of their involvement in the same issues in which I have been engaged. Many of these people have followed me in return, likely for the same reason. </li>
<li>Having a long-standing and active account gives me a certain stature within the community. The curation of tweets over the years provides my account with a sense of authenticity and makes my request for participation appear more genuine to my followers. If I created an account for the sole purpose of this research, the support I received would have likely been much more minimal.</li>
</ol>

<p>The tweets I sent out always included the same key terms—Twitter, community, politics, and #HamOnt (the hashtag for Hamilton)—and a link to the survey. Tweets were concise, topping out at 140 characters because of Twitter's character limits. My goal was to receive at least 50 sets of completed survey responses in order to have enough data to make useful correlations. My Following list on Twitter is fewer than 300 users, many of whom are not Hamiltonians, which made collecting more than 50 completed surveys virtually impossible if I were relying solely on my followers to respond. However, I anticipated that the topic would be of wider interest to several people within Hamilton, who would then retweet it—essentially, a form of snowball sampling. </p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 03</i>McGreal and Coleman attracted the most respondents to my survey, respectively, and also came in second and first when respondents were asked to name "influential members in [their] community".</span>This method worked well: a total of 38 people tweeted or retweeted my survey link to their group of followers. The two most prominent members of that list were Ryan McGreal and Joey Coleman [footnote 03], who between them directed the majority of respondents to the survey. </p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 04</i>Survey statistics are from the survey provider web site, <a href="http://fluidsurveys.com">Fluid Surveys</a>.</span>The survey received a total of 136 anonymous responses during the two weeks it was available online (May 1—14, 2014). Of those respondents, 86 completed the survey, a 64% completion rate, which was impressive given that it took an average of 18 minutes to complete [footnote 04]. The majority completion rate, along with the extensive time required to complete the survey suggests a strong dedication to the topics of community and civic engagement within that particular subset of Hamilton Twitter users. </p>

<p>After I analyzed the results of the surveys, I conducted open-ended interviews with key figures from both sides of recent political movements in Hamilton to enrich the survey findings. The interviews included a set of open-ended questions which allowed the interviewees the opportunity to share opinions and ideas that may not have been considered during the survey phase. In total, four prominent individuals (Justin Jones, Ryan McGreal, Sam Merulla, and Joanna St. Jacques) were interviewed, with each session lasting about one hour. Justin Jones is a co-organizer of the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> movement and a cycling advocate for the Share the Road Cycling Coalition. Ryan McGreal is an activist and the editor of <em>Raise the Hammer</em>, an online Hamilton civic affairs journal. Sam Merulla is the councillor for Hamilton's Ward 4. Joanna St. Jacques is an activist working to stop school closures in Hamilton as well as a campaign manager for several school board trustee campaigns.</p>

<p>The video interviews were edited into a mini-documentary, covering the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> case study from this project and the general topics of community and civic engagement in Hamilton. The final edited documentary is hosted on <a href="http://HamOnt.net">www.HamOnt.net</a>. The web site was created to help communicate this research to those involved in civic engagement and community issues in Hamilton. It offers insights into how slacktivism can help a cause succeed, alerts users to the potential hazards of the digital divide, as well as understanding how community can be fostered within particular groups on Twitter, such as those who become involved in issues of civic engagement. </p>

<p>The web site includes a final draft of this paper, the video documentary (including edited versions of key figure interviews), aggregated survey findings, as well as case studies discussing the history and outcomes of the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> and <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> movements. Interactive timelines and links to outside sources (news articles, relevant tweets, etc.) are included on the web site, extending its usefulness for the greater public.</p>

                        <p>The online residents of the Hamilton Twittersphere have adopted the hashtag #HamOnt (a combination of Hamilton, Ontario) to represent their city in all matters discussed on Twitter—from pride-laden tributes to rallying support for another cause—engaging the people of #HamOnt in politics and ultimately strengthening their communities. For some residents of Hamilton, civic engagement has always been important; city councillor Sam Merulla feels that "It's always been high. For those that are engaged, [they] are engaged on steroids." <a class="ptr">[8]</a> It's only natural then, that these engaged residents of Hamilton would move their debate online to forums like Twitter.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 05</i>The European Business Review (May - June 2009) reported that "[a] major success factor was how Obama’s campaign used social media and technology as an integral part of its strategy, to raise money, and, more importantly, to develop a groundswell of empowered volunteers who felt they could make a difference." and  Monte Lutz, SVP-Digital Public Affairs of Edelman publications claimed that "Barack Obama won the presidency in a landslide victory (by a margin of nearly 200 electoral votes and 8.5 million popular votes) by converting everyday people into engaged and empowered volunteers, donors and advocates through social networks, e-mail advocacy, text messaging and online video."</span>Twitter was becoming a popular forum for politics in 2009, not just in Hamilton but around the world. Twitter reported a 1400% increase in the number of tweets posted in 2009 <a class="ptr">[16]</a>, and 44% of the total Twitter population had signed up between January 2009 and August 2010 <a class="ptr">[4]</a>, suggesting it was reaching critical mass. Twitter was also receiving recognition for its role in events like the 2009 protest in Moldova, where 10,000 protestors successfully organized a rally through Twitter. The US State Department even asked Twitter to defer scheduled maintenance in an effort to avoid interfering with the organization of the June 2009 Tehran student protests. In North America, critics were citing the successful election of Barack Obama to his campaign's social media savvy [footnote 05], and a PEW report cited that "22% of online Americans used social networking or Twitter for politics in [the] 2010 campaign" <a class="ptr">[11]</a>. </p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 06</i>The decision-making process occurred right before a municipal election and was therefore under extra scrutiny by the city's residents.</span>Hamilton, too, was getting involved with Twitter and politics. An "ad hoc group of young professionals committed to city core revitalization" <a class="ptr">[13]</a> started an advocacy web site, "Our City, Our Future" which included a (now-defunct) Twitter account to rally support for a stadium to be built near Hamilton's West harbour and had nearly 3,500 supporters for the cause. The stadium debate focused on where a new venue for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats CFL team, and the 2015 Pan Am games would be built. The city and the Tiger-Cats had differing opinions of where to build the new sports complex—one popular option being Hamilton's west harbour. The Hamilton Spectator, the city's daily newspaper, reported that it would be live-tweeting the stadium debate during city council meetings [footnote 06] and, further, suggested that readers follow Joey Coleman, a local independent reporter who would also be covering the meeting via Twitter <a class="ptr">[12]</a>. As Justin Jones, <em>Yes We Cannon</em> co-organizer, notes "Its an interesting trend in Ontario, and in Canada, where you're seeing voter turnout declining and people kinda starting to tune out politics, on Twitter it seems like its actually turning the opposite." <a class="ptr">[5]</a></p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 07</i>This was the author's first experience with Twitter and politics, as well as <em>Raise the Hammer's</em> editor, Ryan McGreal's, "most organized and coordinated movement... in a central capacity".</span><span><i>Footnote 08</i>Twitter sign-up among survey respondents was the highest in 2009, at 22.5%, and continued strong (18.75%) in 2010.</span>The West Harbour Stadium debate marked the beginning of a sea change for politics in Hamilton [footnote 07] as Twitter gained popularity among civically-minded Hamiltonians. [footnote 08] Since 2009, the city has seen several issues debated on Twitter, including light rail transit, two-way walkable streets, and even whether a local business owner should remove a confederate flag from his storefront. In the fall of 2012, Hamiltonians debated an Ontario Lottery and Gaming-funded casino in the downtown core. Protesters used Twitter to organize a rally at city hall before a council meeting to discuss the casino. The meeting resulted in a "crowd of about 400" from both sides of the debate that "packed into the cramped council chambers and spilled into the foyer" <a class="ptr">[3]</a>, a scene which is extremely rare at city hall. </p>

<p>In 2013, Hamilton saw two particular movements in which Twitter played a central role: the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> (commonly known as #tellOHEverything), an online campaign to have a city-hired PR firm contract terminated, and <em>Yes We Cannon</em>, a campaign to have bike lanes added to Cannon Street by 2015. A prominent blog on civic issues in Hamilton, <em>Raise the Hammer</em>, noted that “Yes We Cannon made strategic use of social media - both Facebook and Twitter - to reach a wide audience in a short amount of time.” CBC Hamilton claimed that protesters involved in ousting Dialogue Partners “[made] the city of Hamilton reconsider how it represents itself on social media. And they did it all on Twitter”. These case studies are important examples of recent successful political movements in Hamilton that highlight the potential effectiveness of slacktivism, the limitations of the digital divide, and the impact activism can have on community. A detailed history of both cases is provided to contextualize the analysis of survey data and the arguments laid out in this paper.</p>

<h3>The Dialogue Partners Fiasco</h3>

<p>The <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> began on January 7, 2013, when the City of Hamilton announced the campaign, <em>Our Voice, Our Hamilton</em>, which aimed to engage Hamiltonians in a discussion about the city's $195 million annual infrastructure deficit and how to deal with future public services. The campaign was managed by the Ottawa-based engagement firm, Dialogue Partners.</p>

<p>That evening, a tweet to the @OurHamilton Twitter account was sent, recommending "[t]he continuation of voluntary pay for disabled on the HSR". Dialogue Partners responded asking "what is 'HSR' just so we can accurately capture your comment". The initials HSR stand for "Hamilton Street Railway", the city's public transit system, and the Hamilton Twitter community interpreted the innocuous tweet as evidence that Dialogue Partners was ill-informed about local culture and was incapable of managing the <em>Our Voice, Our Hamilton</em> campaign. An immediate barrage of angry tweets were sent in reply to the @OurHamilton tweet. This anger grew from the fact that the city was not only asking for help managing a massive annual deficit, while simultaneously spending $376,000 on a consulting firm, but also that the money was leaving the city, going to an Ottawa firm that appeared to lack sufficient knowledge about the city of Hamilton. As <em>Raise the Hammer</em> editor, Ryan McGreal, put it: "It was kind of outrageous that they were supposed be engaging Hamiltonians and didn't seem to know anything about Hamilton." <a class="ptr">[7]</a></p>

<p>What grew from that ill-fated message was a "spontaneous movement that sprang up because one person said just the right thing and posted it to Twitter at the right moment. And it was witty and pithy and caught people's attention" <a class="ptr">[7]</a>. A tweet suggesting that Hamilton Twitter users share details about Hamilton with Dialogue Partners via #TellOHEverything was posted, and within 45 minutes, the hashtag was trending nationally <a class="ptr">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The #TellOHEverything hashtag was an homage to the #TellVicEverything hashtag that had been created in response to a House of Commons bill (Bill C34), sponsored by Public Safety Minister Vic Toews, which presented a potential loss of privacy to Canadian Internet users. The #TellOHEverything campaign saw a total of 607 contributors posting a total 2898 tweets, most of these messages within the first 24 hours. Even Dialogue Partners had to admit that things had "gone really wrong, really fast" <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. Dialogue Partners apologized less than 24 hours after the fiasco began, but the apology fell on deaf ears, as more tweets under the #tellOHEverything hashtag continued to flood the @OurHamilton account.</p>

<p>The @OurHamilton account did have its supporters, despite the large backlash to their regrettable tweet. Tweets in support acknowledged the misstep, but encouraged others to move past the blunder in the hope that the engagement efforts would continue, and hopefully create positive change for the city. Supporters compared the #tellOHEverything posters to "a bunch of jocks ganging up on a rival high school team" and even as far as suggesting that the campaign was a "public lynching" <a class="ptr">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>Two days after the <em>Our Voice, Our Hamilton</em> campaign began, Dialogue Partners shut down the project's web site at the request of the city because of "offensive and inaccurate content." The city was concerned about malicious code that had been added to the site. Dialogue Partners also unpublished their Facebook page. Finally, all dialogue stopped from the <em>Our Voice, Our Hamilton</em> campaign, again at the request of the city. City council unanimously agreed to cancel the contract with Dialogue Partners, even though several councillors expressed sympathy for the situation the firm had encountered. Councillor Lloyd Ferguson told CBC Hamilton, "I feel bad for Dialogue Partners. Some of the social media people were harsh," and Councillor Scott Duvall felt that the situation "just spun out of control" <a class="ptr">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>CBC Hamilton wrote: "It took just over 600 people to push an experienced communications firm to the brink and make the city of Hamilton reconsider how it represents itself on social media. And they did it all on Twitter." <a class="ptr">[1]</a> The significance of the event was that "a community self-organizing in an organic way to push for change" <a class="ptr">[7]</a> could cripple a firm which specializes in social media communication and convince city hall to cancel a $376,000 contract, all online via Twitter.</p>

<h3>Yes We Cannon</h3>

<p>In May 2013, the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> campaign to "create a bi-directional bike lane, running the full length of Cannon Street, by 2015" <a class="ptr">[15]</a> in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was officially launched online. The campaign was created "to give downtown Hamilton something they could say 'yes' to" <a class="ptr">[5]</a>, and Twitter played a significant role in the success of the campaign. The awareness created through Twitter and other social media platforms, like Facebook, brought in over 500 signatures to the online petition within the first 24 hours. The initial support was impressive, but a councillor representing a ward impacted by the new bike lanes told media that while he was in support of the plan and had heard from supporters, he had also heard from "residents enraged by the plan" <a class="ptr">[14]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Yes We Cannon</em> urged council to build a two-way cycle track (a physically separated bike path) on Cannon Street by July 2015, in time for the city to host 32 soccer matches for the Pan Am games. Organizers chose Cannon Street for their campaign because Hamilton needed an active transportation route between the forthcoming James Street GO station and the Pan Am games stadium (Tim Horton's field, formerly Ivor Wynne stadium). The Cannon Street cycle track will not only prove beneficial to Pan Am spectators (especially given the new bike share program in Hamilton), but it will also benefit commuters when all-day train service starts at the new GO station in 2015.</p>

<p>Cannon Street is listed as a priority in the city of Hamilton's <em>Shifting Gears Bicycle Master Plan</em> and is slated for resurfacing during construction of the Pan Am stadium. Given these facts, and the fact that Cannon is generally recognized as an under-utilized roadway in the city, <em>Yes We Cannon</em> organizers felt it was the ideal roadway to endorse for their campaign.</p>

<p>Three months after the campaign began, a motion for council to approve "a bi-directional bike lane [to] be installed as a pilot project on the south side of Cannon Street from Sherman Avenue to Bay Street" <a class="ptr">[6]</a> was put forward.</p>

<p>On March 19, 2014 the motion for the Cannon Street pilot project, at an estimated total cost of $1.6 million, was unanimously approved by council, despite concerns from some members of council regarding a lack of public consultation. Councillor Brad Clark put forward a motion to include a 30-day public consultation, but was defeated in a vote of 10-3.</p>

                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="literature-review" id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
                        <p>There are numerous theories discussing the public sphere, civic engagement, community, and Twitter. These topics are relevant to my research on Twitter and civic engagement in the Hamilton context because Twitter's communication model may offer a new Internet-based public sphere . Civic engagement on Twitter also supports the growth of new communities online. Some authors suggest, however, that all of these notions are simply idealistic beliefs that cannot be fully realized while a digital divide persists. Investigating these themes individually is a necessary first step to be able to make connections between them and form proper hypothesis on the topics. This literature review will focus on Twitter and how it relates to scholarship on the public sphere, community, civic engagement, and the digital divide.</p>

<h3>How Twitter Affects the Public Sphere</h3>

<p>Twitter's mission statement is "to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers." While the original intent of Twitter was to communicate with friends, family, and coworkers <a class="ptr">[5]</a>, the mission statement seems to suggest a slant towards supporting the public sphere and democracy. Clay Shirky, suggests that Twitter acts as a host for a networked public sphere <a class="ptr">[18]</a>, a notion supported by other researchers <a class="ptr">[10]</a> <a class="ptr">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>Habermas defines the public sphere as a place where "private people come together as a public...to engage... in a debate over the general rules governing relations" <a class="ptr">[10]</a>. One of the biggest factors for Twitter's ability to maintain this public sphere—allowing people to come together as a public—is the fact that it is free to individual users <a class="ptr">[18]</a> <a class="ptr">[12]</a>, although detractors would argue that the cost of Internet access is negated when referencing Twitter as "free".</p>

<p>The public sphere is a place to debate politics, and according to a 2013 PEW Internet survey on Civic Engagement in the Digital Age, "39% of American adults took part in some sort of political activity in the context of a social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter" <a class="ptr">[20]</a>. The concern surrounding Twitter politics, however, is that, if an individual only follows those with similar interests, s/he may only receive information that reinforces previous beliefs <a class="ptr">[4]</a>. Users do interact with those who share different political ideology, but they rarely share (retweet) that information to their followers <a class="ptr">[4]</a>, making politics on Twitter extremely partisan <a class="ptr">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the tenets of Habermas's concept of the public sphere is that the public can discuss and debate politics as equals, without concern of prejudice. A common belief about Twitter, and the Internet in general, is that it democratizes the online population. On Twitter, users can avoid the disclosure of their age, race, or gender <a class="ptr">[10]</a> <a class="ptr">[16]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a>. These physical and social cues can be used to reinforce power and imply authority, leading to unequal communication between people if revealed <a class="ptr">[19]</a>. The anonymity afforded by Twitter democratizes the playing field for Twitter users to engage as an equal within the public sphere and politics <a class="ptr">[14]</a>. Online anonymity can be a drawback, however. Critics like Sherry Turkle argue that while nobody knows you are a dog (to paraphrase the infamous New Yorker cartoon), "so much posturing, "gender-switching" and faking of identities can take place that it is extremely difficult for any real relationship to be created and maintained" <a class="ptr">[25]</a>. Additionally, online anonymity gives users the ability to "engage in verbal combat" <a class="ptr">[10]</a>, often referred to as flaming or trolling <a class="ptr">[14]</a> <a class="ptr">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether Twitter can be understood as a Habermasian public sphere, users engaged in politics on Twitter come together because of a shared interest, which has community building potential <a class="ptr">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3>How Twitter Affects Community</h3>

<p>Critics of the idea that communities can exist online through Twitter argue that community needs "strong ties"—or strong friendships—to exist, and that strong ties are scarce in online social networks <a class="ptr">[6]</a> <a class="ptr">[9]</a> <a class="ptr">[11]</a>. It may be true that there is an excess of weak ties on Twitter, but as Barry Wellman and Milena Gulia point out: "communities do not have to be solid groups of densely-knit neighbours but could also exist as social networks of kin, friends, and workmates who do not necessarily live in the same neighorhoods" <a class="ptr">[24]</a>. Communities are made up of strong <em>and</em> weak ties; perhaps the abundance of weak ties is merely an issue of scale. David Smith supports this argument, suggesting that online social networks, such as Twitter, are "broad [weak ties] as well as deep [strong ties]" <a class="ptr">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Communicating through Twitter takes time. Critics feel that the time spent online negatively impacts face-to-face interactions with friends and family, suggesting that there is a time tradeoff amounting to an exponential loss of real world interaction for every minute spent online <a class="ptr">[23]</a> <a class="ptr">[17]</a>. Detractors further claim that the time spent online leaves the user "alone" and encourages depression and loneliness <a class="ptr">[23]</a> <a class="ptr">[17]</a>. Several studies, however, have found that Internet users have as much real world contact as non-users and that the time spent online has no impact on these interactions <a class="ptr">[23]</a>. Moreover, research has revealed that Internet users have more friendships/strong ties than non-users <a class="ptr">[23]</a> <a class="ptr">[13]</a> <a class="ptr">[7]</a> and that “long-term Internet usage is associated with more, not less, frequent sociability" <a class="ptr">[25]</a>. Not only are Internet users more socially connected than non-users, but there is no evidence of alienation or depression related to Internet usage <a class="ptr">[23]</a>. Twitter, then, can be seen as a tool to facilitate and compliment these face-to-face interactions <a class="ptr">[22]</a>.</p>

<h3>The Digital Divide and Civic Engagement through Twitter</h3>

<p>A concern regarding civic engagement on Twitter is the lack of representation of lower income families and racialized minorities <a class="ptr">[25]</a>. This imbalance of demographic representation is often referred to as the "digital divide". Critics fear that only the elite have access to this new communication medium, leaving lower-income citizens out of the debate. </p>

<p>The digital divide is shrinking <a class="ptr">[25]</a>, but until it disappears completely there is concern that the lack of access by certain demographics hinders democratic participation, leaving the floodgates open for "'net-savvy' special interest communities who could pursue their own agenda at the cost of the public commonweal" <a class="ptr">[25]</a>. A 2013 PEW Internet survey states that the digital divide is not the drastic concern that critics make it out to be, indicating that "income related differences are more modest [online]" and that "[online] political participation is more balanced between lower and higher income Americans" <a class="ptr">[20]</a>. Further, "those at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum are generally less involved with the day-to-day outreach, chatter, and discussion around political issues — regardless of whether those discussions take place in physical or digital spaces" <a class="ptr">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Some critics argue that Twitter users involved in civic engagement are not truly participating; being a Facebook fan or Tweeting about a cause only shows awareness and not action <a class="ptr">[1]</a>. This is often referred to as "slacktivism" and is seen as an insufficient approach to civic engagement. Conceding the fact that slacktivism is real, this <em>awareness</em> of the cause greatly increases the potential for real engagement and participation <a class="ptr">[8]</a>, giving these part-time activists more agency on how they contribute to the cause <a class="ptr">[16]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><a class="button expand" href="/study/civic-engagement">Continue reading: Civic Engagement</a></p>

                    
                 
                    
                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="civic-engagement" id="civic-engagement">Civic Engagement</h2>
                        <p>Twitter is, essentially, a soapbox: the one-to-many broadcast network allows anyone and everyone with Internet access to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions. In the case of the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em>, a simple tweet—"Anyone remember #TellVicEverything? Let's try strategy with @OurHamilton. Maybe #TellOHEverything?"—from Twitter user Michael Pett inspired a "spontaneous movement that sprang up because one person said just the right thing and posted it to Twitter at the right moment" <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. Less than 24 hours later hundreds of individuals had joined the movement, sharing fake, and often amusing, facts about Hamilton to the Dialogue Partners' @OurHamilton account. The idea was shared, the people saw it, and they engaged.</p>

<p>Critics question whether engaging in politics through Twitter is truly participating; posting tweets or retweeting a political message only shows awareness and not necessarily action <a class="ptr">[1]</a>. This low effort approach to civic engagement is commonly referred to as "slacktivism" and, while critics feel it does not directly create change, some believe that slacktivism helps the cause by bringing more attention to the movement, by helping spread the word. <a class="ptr">[12]</a> <a class="ptr">[14]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a> Although slacktivism may be seen as a form of armchair activism, the case studies discussed in this research suggest that it can be effective in creating change.</p>

<p>Retweets in support of a movement may be of concern for some users who worry about being linked to a particular group or cause. The worry of being identified is of increasing concern when the risks are higher, such as in movements like the Arab Springs. Twitter provides potential anonymity to these users by removing the necessity to disclose age, gender, or race, ultimately providing an opportunity for everyone to participate as equals. <a class="ptr">[5]</a> <a class="ptr">[12]</a> <a class="ptr">[2]</a>  Removing these social barriers creates a horizontality within the movement that may not exist with traditional media. This democratization lowers the barrier for entry among potential protesters and allows everyone the chance to participate <a class="ptr">[6]</a>, resulting in a lack of clear leadership; today's protests may not be represented by a single persona like Martin Luther King Jr. was for the American Civil Rights Movement decades earlier. The multitude of voices replaces the need for a leader and makes it easier for everyone to collaborate, coordinate, and share their opinions <a class="ptr">[8]</a>. </p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 09</i><em>Raise the Hammer's</em> account sat between Coleman and Babcock in the rankings, but it is an organizational account, rather than an individual, so it was not included in this discussion.</span>This inherent lack of leadership is apparent in the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> case study, where a group of individuals came together to effect change "without anything of what you would consider a traditional organizational structure behind it" <a class="ptr">[10]</a>. McGreal, an individual who has been involved at various levels of multiple movements in Hamilton believes that "[the] idea that campaigns have leaders is a bit of a misnomer; I think people either care enough to get involved or they don't. And if they do care, and if there's somebody there to facilitate that, then it happens. It's like a piece of string; you can't push on it" <a class="ptr">[10]</a>. Although it is true that the Dialogue Partners campaign was not organized by any particular individual(s), it is clear that some voices were louder than others in the Twittersphere the night of January 7, 2013. Community members Joey Coleman and Laura Babcock tweeted significantly more than the other 605 people who posted using the #tellOHEverything hashtag. They were also the most retweeted, and ultimately, had the most significant reach out of any participants to the movement [footnote 09]. As community activist, Joanna St. Jacques explained, "You can be a voice in the crowd or one strong voice in a crowd." <a class="ptr">[14]</a></p>

<p>A horizontality among activists may indeed exist—as it does in the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> case study—but this levelled playing field does not include equal representation from all socioeconomic groups. It is important to note that Hamilton's civically engaged Twitter population appears to be made up primarily of well educated, high-income earning white residents. There may well be a horizontality amongst those participating in civic engagement on Twitter, but at the core, there is still a clear lack of equal representation (see section on <a href="/study/06-digital-divide.html">digital divide</a>). </p>

<p>The PEW Research Center report on <em>Civic Engagement in the Digital Age</em> states that the well-educated and the well-off "have always been more likely to be active in politics and community affairs offline" <a class="ptr">[13]</a>, but it is clear to those engaged in politics and civic engagement that things are changing. <em>Yes We Cannon</em> organizer, Justin Jones, believes that "Twitter is really becoming the forum for political engagement, in at least in that superficial way and then when you really want to dig down you need to move this conversations offline. I think its a great place for people to get that first taste of engagement." <a class="ptr">[8]</a> City of Hamilton councillor, Sam Merulla agrees: "[Twitter is] more superficial in nature, but I think it allows me to start the discussion, which then can be expanded upon in forums such as Facebook." <a class="ptr">[11]</a> This superficiality is a growing concern regarding civic engagement on social media networks, like Twitter, because   participants may not be truly committed to the cause. There is no doubt that some Twitter users' engagement may be halfhearted, but it does not mean that social media cannot be used effectively for social change; even slacktivism can help the cause by bringing more attention to the movement by spreading the word of the movement through retweets <a class="ptr">[12]</a> <a class="ptr">[15]</a>. Ultimately there is an exponential number of potential protesters watching the goings-on surrounding the movement, increasing the likelihood for a larger than expected turnout on the day of protest <a class="ptr">[3]</a>. These part-time activists have greater agency over <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> they choose to physically participate in a movement.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 10</i>The Facebook event page has 34 confirmed attendees for the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> bike parade, and the Spectator newspaper refers to "dozens" of participants.</span>The <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> occurred solely online. No protest or march ever took place. The sudden and spontaneous rise of the movement, the fact that many of the tweets were in jest, and that the majority of participation came from retweets, suggests that the movement not only had an active group of slacktivists, but that the protest was <em>founded</em> on slacktivism.  The <em>Yes We Cannon</em> movement had over 2300 people sign an online petition in support of the Cannon Street bike lanes, but when organizers planned a "bike parade" down Cannon Street in June 2013, only a handful of cyclists came out in support [footnote 10]. This lack of physical representation suggests that the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> movement saw a large percentage of slacktivist participation, too, yet both movements succeeded in their respective goals.</p>

<p>A snapshot of slacktivism in Hamilton shows that a large majority of respondents use Twitter for politics, although just over half feel that they belong to a political or social issues group (figure 01a&ndash;b), suggesting that they may not be fully engaged participants in local political movements. Further to that point, less than half of the respondents reported participating in the Hamilton-specific causes listed in the survey even though they knew of them (figure 02) —yet an overwhelming majority have used Twitter to share their political beliefs in some way (figure 03a&ndash;e).</p>

<p>Critics of slacktivism argue that it is too easy to share information via social media, and that messages are often hearsay <a class="ptr">[4]</a>. Journalist Malcolm Gladwell pointed out that the vast majority of tweets during the Arab Spring came from the West and were written in English instead of local dialects such as Farsi <a class="ptr">[4]</a>. In the case of the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em>, several rumours were circulated on Twitter, stirring the pot and inciting more upset. Messages via social media may not always be truthful or accurate, but they are always human. This hint of human emotion gives greater legitimacy to the messages being sent and can foster sympathy from those not involved. These broadcasts, truthful or not, can help shape the narrative of the protest, especially since they are seen as coming from the ones engaged in the movement. Slacktivism may not create true engagement, but it can help the movement, perhaps only for the reason that it may superficially inflate the size of the crowd.</p>

<p><a class="button expand" href="/study/digital-divide">Continue reading: Digital Divide</a></p>
                    
                 
                    
                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="digital-divide" id="digital-divide">Digital Divide</h2>
                        <p>Joanna St. Jacques, an activist fighting to keep local schools open around Hamilton observes "The Twitter community is pretty powerful. We brought together 1200 people through different petitions. Now we interact on a fairly regular basis." <a class="ptr">[7]</a> There is no argument that Twitter is a powerful mobilization tool for activists, but as seen in the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> example earlier, there is concern over who is engaging with these movements online. There is concern that lower income families and racialized minorities are not represented <a class="ptr">[9]</a> equally on Twitter. This imbalance of demographic representation is often referred to as the "digital divide". Critics fear that leaving lower-income citizens out of the debate provides a way for "'net-savvy' special interest communities... [to] pursue their own agenda at the cost of the public commonweal" <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. The survey data collected for this study suggests that there is a very real and very distinct digital divide in the city of Hamilton. This should be of concern, not just to the city's politicians listening to the Twitter voices, but to the activists themselves, as they may not actually be affecting change for the "common good".</p>

<p>The <em>digital divide</em> is a term used to define the imbalance between individuals who are marginalized—by income, gender, race, or sexual orientation <a class="ptr">[9]</a>—and those who are not. Essentially, it is "[the] difference between the haves and have nots" <a class="ptr">[9]</a> when it comes to access to the Internet. The "haves" are typically male, white, urban, high income earners, and highly educated, but in North America, Internet access is almost evenly split amongst men and women <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. This gender equality is further supported by statistics that show women account for 53% of Twitter's user base <a class="ptr">[2]</a> and the fact that 52.3% of the respondents to the survey were women. To be clear, the digital divide is not a hard line, but rather a shifting gap between these various groups of individuals <a class="ptr">[8]</a> as each group has different needs and expects different outcomes from the Internet <a class="ptr">[9]</a>.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 11</i>Hamilton's low-income families account for 14.3% of the population, compared to 11.7% for the provincial average. The unemployment rate sits at 6.8%, compared to 7.4% provincially. 16.4% of the population is employed in manufacturing.</span><span><i>Footnote 12</i>The Strathcona neighbourhood (postal code L8R) has seen an 87% increase in housing prices over the past decade. Strathcona is centrally located between up-and-coming and gentrified areas like Westdale village, Locke Street South, and James Street North. It is also close to several city medical facilities, McMaster University, and McMaster's Innovation park (a premiere research park). Lastly, Strathcona abuts Highway 403, providing easy access to Toronto. These landmarks suggest that Strathcona is an ideal location for a well-educated person looking to earn a high income locally or with easy access to a job in the GTA.</span>Hamilton has a higher-than-average number of low-income families and a large contingent of blue-collar workers [footnote 11], many of whom have been forced out of their manufacturing jobs at employers like the local steel mills. At the same time, the city is seeing an influx of residents from the Greater Toronto Area looking for affordable housing within the city and is becoming a haven for people commuting to Toronto for work (effectively a bedroom community) [footnote 12]. These two distinctly different groups of residents would seem to be making the city diverse, but the diversity is not found on Twitter. Although some research shows the digital divide to be shrinking <a class="ptr">[9]</a>, within Hamilton's Twitter population, political discussion is dominated by individuals who represent the quintessential "haves".</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 13</i>The Postal codes/Forward Sortation Areas most densely occupied by respondents also happens to be in the midst of gentrification. Hamilton's gentrification is moving West, from the Westdale neighbourhood, East.</span>Analysis of the Twitter population that responded to the survey shows a pronounced digital divide. Breaking down the statistics, based on the definition of digital divide noted above, the population studied is evenly balanced between males (46.5%) and females (52.3%), as is the norm in North America. A mere 2.3% of the respondents identify as a visible minority, making the vast majority of the population of this study white. A review of respondents by postal code shows that the majority of respondents live in the lower city of Hamilton, specifically in the downtown (urban) core [footnote 13]. Even when the number of respondents is compared against 2011 census data for Forward Sortation Area populations (which are identical to the first three digits of Canadian postal codes), there is a clear predominance of responses from these urban areas(figure 04a&ndash;b).</p>

<p>Additionally, a comparison of household income against family size shows a very striking number of Hamiltonians who live well above the national poverty line, the majority of which earn $70,000+ (figure 05). Finally, there is a large contingent of respondents who are highly educated and have earned a university degree or higher. The level of education among respondents is noticeably higher than the provincial average when compared to the 2012 Statistics Canada Canadian Internet Use Survey (figure 06). Combined, these correlations suggest a very pronounced digital divide in Hamilton, in regard to those who are interested in civic engagement via Twitter.</p>

<p>A 2013 PEW Internet survey on <em>Civic Engagement in the Digital Age</em> claims that "[t]raditional political activities are most common among the well-educated and financially well-off, regardless of whether they take place online or offline. On social networking sites, income-related differences are more modest — but civic engagement in these spaces is still most prevalent among those with higher educational levels." <a class="ptr">[6]</a>. This seems to be reflected within the survey data collected; while the household income is significantly high for the upper-middle class, there does appear to be some representation from each household income bracket, suggesting that while the dominant representation is from financially well-off families, there is also notable representation from other income levels (figure 07). Adding to the PEW argument, the sample population seems to have a higher-than-average group of well-educated individuals.</p>

<p>A concern over the persisting digital divide is that the those at the upper end of the socio-economic scale can dominate public discussion, opening the possibility for net-savvy special interest groups to control the political agenda <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. This concern is realized when the Dialogue Partners fiasco and <em>Yes We Cannon</em> movements are considered. The Twitter users involved in the Dialogue Partners fiasco movement persuaded city council to cancel a $376,000 contract , but only 607 people tweeted or retweeted posts on Twitter to the #tellOHEverything hashtag—just over 0.1% of the total population of Hamilton. An extremely small percentage of the population, in a matter of hours, convinced city hall to cancel the PR firms contract, despite $242,000 of the contract already being paid. This suggests that participation on Twitter begets change, but for a extreme minority of the population. The <em>Yes We Cannon</em> campaign saw roughly four times the participation that the Dialogue Partners fiasco saw, but that still only accounts for roughly 0.5% of Hamilton's population. Again, an extremely small portion of the overall population convinced the local government (who voted unanimously in favour of the bike lanes) to make significant change to the city’s infrastructure, a historically controversial issue. Although critics of these initiatives worry that they advance priorities held by only a tiny minority, another possibility, especially given the extensive research showing the benefits of complete streets to a wide range of people, is that this small group of civically engaged citizens has a distinctive ability to influence change for the common good.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 14</i>McGreal came in second when respondents were asked to name "influential members in [their] community".</span>The survey data suggests a strong digital divide in the city of Hamilton, and there are genuine concerns that a small group of individuals can control the politics of the city. Ryan McGreal, editor of <em>Raise The Hammer</em>, an online Hamilton civic affairs journal, and one of the most influential individuals in the city [Footnote 14] believes that Twitter "is a middle class conceit; it's a privilege" <a class="ptr">[5]</a>. As another Hamilton resident points out, "Twitter users in Hamilton simply do not represent the much wider and demographically diverse communities of our city." <a class="ptr">[1]</a> This concern limits the effectiveness of Twitter as a form of networked public sphere. Nancy Fraser points out that "the media that constitute the material support for the circulation of views are privately owned and operated for profit. Consequently, subordinated social groups usually lack equal access to the material means of equal participation." <a class="ptr">[4]</a> To apply Fraser's argument to this case: while Twitter may be free to join, the cost of getting online may be too high for lower-income families and individuals. This barrier-to-entry may hinder new immigrants, less-educated individuals, the unemployed, and others from participating in public discourse. Twitter, as a platform may be open and accessible to all, but because it must be accessed through a larger infrastructure—the Internet—it can fail to be accessible, leaving Twitter to be dominated by a group of like-minded, similar individuals (high-earning, well-educated, white), much like Habermas’s bourgeois public sphere.</p>

                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="community" id="community">Community</h2>
                        <p>Every interview I conducted for this research included an anecdote about recognizing or <em>knowing</em> someone from Twitter whom the interviewee had encountered on the street or while patronizing a local business. I, too, have had this experience in Hamilton several times, and it's this sense of community that Twitter seems to support. Community is the driving force for why this group of net-savvy, civic-minded, and engaged Hamiltonians work towards affecting change in their city. <em>Yes We Cannon</em> co-organizer, Justin Jones stated: "I love Hamilton. I've never felt at home in a place as I do here. And I think a lot of that really does owe to the degree to which I'm connected through both social media and more traditional means. But social media was really my foot in the door, I think, to a lot of stuff in this community." <a class="ptr">[7]</a> Ryan McGreal, editor of <em>Raise The Hammer</em>, an online Hamilton civic affairs journal, spoke fondly, too, of his community when I asked about his feelings towards it.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love the street I live on. I love the neighbourhood that I live in. I love being able to go for walk down Locke Street and kind of feeling the energy in the air. You run into somebody you know and you have a stop and chat with them. I always book a little extra time into any of my errands because I know I'm going to run into somebody and we're going to fall into a conversation. I like that about where I live. I like that I live in an <em>actual</em> neighbourhood where there's a real community. <a class="ptr">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Critics argue that communities require <em>strong ties</em>, or close relationships, to exist, and that Twitter cannot foster community because it consists of too many <em>weak ties</em>. The terms strong and weak ties stems from the theory of the <em>Stength of Weak Ties</em>, developed by researcher Mark Granovetter, which in simple terms states that there are two categories of ties, "strong" and "weak", in essence, "friend" and "acquaintance", respectively <a class="ptr">[5]</a>. Weak ties are the people you know as acquaintances—old high school friends, co-workers, friends of friends—and would not consider them to be close friends. The strength of weak ties is that they help spread information quickly; someone without a network of several weak ties would be confined to the ideas and opinions of a just a few close friends <a class="ptr">[6]</a>. This idea can be seen in children's games, jokes, and various tales told on the playground. The same activities and stories will be retold across great distances, suggesting that they have been passed from child to child to travel such a long way—the stories have been passed on from weak tie to weak tie <a class="ptr">[6]</a>. The same way weak ties share children's stories, they also help spread political opinion and news of civic engagement issues, bridging one group to another <a class="ptr">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Communities are made up of strong <em>and</em> weak ties on Twitter, and the abundance of weak ties may simply be an issue of scale. David Smith supports this argument, suggesting that online social networks, such as Twitter, are "broad [weak ties] as well as deep [strong ties]" <a class="ptr">[9]</a>. Community is a broad term and can hold many different meanings, depending on the area of research in which it is being discussed. For the purposes of this research, community is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a network of individuals connected online via Twitter, who share common geographic boundaries (the city of Hamilton), a shared interest (civic engagement), and share a certain communion amongst one another (civic pride). Further, members of the community participate in building social capital, providing help in the expectation of reciprocation, and support a culture of trust and honesty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weak ties often exist on Twitter because of shared interests, such as political alignment, and if two of the people in a social network have a common friend, then it is more likely that they will become friends themselves—a strong tie—in the future <a class="ptr">[3]</a>. Strong ties require more time and effort to maintain than weak ones <a class="ptr">[6]</a> <a class="ptr">[3]</a> and only so many strong ties can be maintained as there are only so many hours in the day <a class="ptr">[3]</a>; this is equally true in real life as it is for our online social networks.</p>

<p>Twitter is ideal for building and maintaining weak ties <a class="ptr">[4]</a>, and the more weak ties one has, the more likely they will be connected to a strong tie, increasing the likelihood of building more close friendships/strong ties over time. <a class="ptr">[3]</a> Additionally, one can only have so many strong ties due to the efforts required to maintain those friendships in the first place. Given these tenets, and with the definition of community laid out above, it could be posited that Twitter does indeed foster community online, and given the geographic constraints of civic engagement in Hamilton, this community could extend offline as well.</p>

<p>According to an in-depth look at Twitter by Sysomos, a "social intelligence engine" created by computer scientists at the University of Toronto, the average Twitter user has less than 100 followers (93.6%) and follows less than 100 users (92.4%) (figure 08). A mere 0.68% has over 1000 followers and 0.94% follow greater than 1000 people. On the surface, these system-wide averages could suggest that Twitter is, in fact, a strong tie network given the high percentage of people who follow and are followed by small groups (presumably friends and family). Further to that point, less than one percent of all Twitter users are followed by or follow greater than 1000 people. The respondents to my survey, however, do not fit this average. Over half of the respondents claimed that they follow over 1000 other users, and 37.65% stated that they have more than 1000 followers. Those with followers/following counts less than 100 drop to 28.24% and 15.12%, respectively. These numbers suggest that there is a very large network of weak ties among civically engaged Twitter users in the sample studied. This argument is further substantiated by the fact that nearly half of the respondents claimed to have less than ten close friends connected to their Twitter accounts (figure 09)</p>

</div>

<p>Does this mean that community can't exist online through Twitter? Anecdotal data suggests that there is a strong sense of community amongst the survey population; interviewee Justin Jones—who follows 557 users and is followed by 603— argued that Twitter was instrumental in building community when he moved to Hamilton</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter's been extremely helpful for me to become a part of the community. It's introduced me to a lot of the people that I know. It's introduced me to a lot of the ideas that I think are very important to community development. I think it needs to be viewed as a tool in a toolkit of building community. And I think to that extent, it's really important to recognize that it can be used to foster community if it's used in the right way. <a class="ptr">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and interviewee Ryan McGreal—who follows 2,181 users and is followed by 3,361—states that "one of the things that I like about Twitter is that it has put me in contact with people right across the city, people outside of my immediate neighbourhood." <a class="ptr">[8]</a></p>

<p>Both of these individuals have higher-than-average following/follower counts which are so large that it would suggest that their networks are built from weak ties, yet they feel that community exists through Twitter, and more importantly, that Twitter fosters this sense of community.</p>

<p>If we assume that weak ties do not determine the strength of community, to what extent does Twitter impact community? First, it is important to understand what benefits Twitter provides that face-to-face interactions can't. Results of the survey indicate that Twitter provides users with a wider range of information and news than they would receive if they were not on Twitter. The social network also provides them with greater access and reach to members of their community, as well as more interaction and engagement with that community. Activist Joanna St. Jacques agrees, noting that "Twitter has definitely been an introduction to the community for me. I've been able to communicate all over the city, the province, and further." <a class="ptr">[10]</a> When asked how Twitter has affected their sense of community, nearly a third of respondents said that they were more informed about their community, and several respondents also stated that they had access to a more diverse population and felt more connected to those in their community. St. Jacques believes that Twitter is "a tool for bringing people together over causes or a community," <a class="ptr">[10]</a> and Justin Jones sums it up by saying that he uses Twitter "to better connect with [his] community" <a class="ptr">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the extent to which Twitter has impacted their sense of community, the majority of respondents felt that Twitter had a strong and positive impact (figure 10). It is clear that Twitter seems to foster a strong sense of community online, but how does it affect the "real world"/offline community? Joanna St. Jacques, said that "offline, it's [Twitter that's] brought us together." <a class="ptr">[10]</a>, claiming that her offline community is stronger because of Twitter. Survey data suggests that Twitter has had a somewhat positive impact on respondents' offline communities as well, but not nearly to the same extent as their online ones (figure 11). That said, nearly one third of respondents have met more than five people offline after meeting them first through Twitter, and almost two thirds of respondents had met at least one person under the same circumstance (figure 12). The most striking argument that Twitter has a positive effect on offline communities is when looking at the time respondents spend volunteering, compared against their overall sense of community and how it is affected by Twitter. The data shows that the more impact respondents felt Twitter had on their community, and the more positive they perceived that impact to be, the more time they invested in volunteering as a whole (figure 13). This suggests that there may be a stronger effect on the offline community than respondents may recognize because, while they feel that the impact offline is minimal in comparison to the offline communities, the personal time they give back suggests otherwise.</p>

<p><span><i>Footnote 15</i>Six respondents explicitly stated "hugs" were a benefit of face-to-face interaction over Twitter. This simple suggestion gave the researcher "warm fuzzies" and personally validated the research.</span>The survey shows a correlation in the data, suggesting that Twitter may be affect offline community, though to what extent is still somewhat uncertain. Regardless, one thing is clear: face-to-face interaction facilitates some things that simply can't be attained through Twitter. The respondents were clear that in-depth, detailed conversation could not be maintained through Twitter. The 140-character limit imposed by social network proves challenging to hold a <em>true</em> conversation. Justin Jones feels that Twitter is "a great way to start conversations and then to actually keep them going in real life and in forums that allow for a more robust discussion and community building" <a class="ptr">[7]</a>. Respondents also noted that body language, social cues, and verbal inflection are things that are all too often lost in translation through Twitter, making terse sentences difficult to interpret properly at times. Academics agree that the 140 character text-only nature of Twitter communication limits our abilities to convey the nuanced visual cues we give in face-to-face conversation and limit our abilities to sufficiently convey emotion <a class="ptr">[1]</a> <a class="ptr">[11]</a>. Twitter text can clearly change the way the message is understood by the reader compared to face-to-face interactions, but "words on a screen are [still] quite capable of moving one to laughter or tears, of evoking anger or compassion, of creating a community from a collection of strangers" <a class="ptr">[11]</a>. The most obvious benefit of face-to-face interactions is the physical contact people receive from each other. A high five or pat on the back, a warm embrace or a gentle touch all go unfulfilled online, despite an emoji's best efforts to convey such physicality. [footnote 15]</p>

<p>Community, according to Harold Rheingold, requires an exchange of words and ideas <a class="ptr">[11]</a>, and while Twitter facilitates this exchange, it does not require it. Users often follow multiple others without ever replying to their messages, or even reading them in the first place <a class="ptr">[3]</a> <a class="ptr">[12]</a>. This communication breakdown suggests that a true community cannot exist and, further, that Twitter, for this reason, cannot function as a form of public sphere. Discourse and debate are paramount to the success of the public sphere, and if no exchange takes place, can Twitter truly function as a networked public sphere? Michael Warner argues that "merely paying attention can be enough to make you a member" <a class="ptr">[13]</a> of a public; by that measure, simply reading every tweet should constitute a member's role within the public sphere. In this case, we may be paying attention to the dialogue but there is no assurance that a debate will take place; users certainly interact with those who hold different political ideology at times, but "they very rarely share information from across the divide with other members of their community" <a class="ptr">[2]</a>. Ultimately, it seems, politics on Twitter are extremely partisan <a class="ptr">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><a class="button expand" href="/study/conclusion">Continue reading: Conclusion</a></p>

                    
                 
                    
                        <h2 data-magellan-destination="conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>After an in-depth look at a community of Twitter users in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, exploring aspects of community-building and civic engagement in the city, it is clear that Twitter is a powerful tool that some civically engaged citizens in Hamilton have embraced and learned to use to their benefit, despite the fact that it clearly has its limitations.  Both the cases of the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> and the <em>Yes We Cannon</em> movement demonstrate that a small group of engaged citizens can indeed have a big impact on city hall and create change. These same people have shown that Twitter can also help strengthen and foster community, both online and offline, ultimately building a better city in which to live. This change, however, is left in the hands of a group that is largely white and upper-middle class, with an agenda that does not necessarily align with that of the rest of the city's population. No data was collected to indicate that this is the case in Hamilton, but it is important that both the activists and the politicians remain cognizant of the fact that there is an online and offline gap in political participation, which is rooted in broader social inequalities </p>

<p>Some may be alarmed at the very thought that a privileged group of individuals on Twitter has such influence in the city, but other factors also account for their influence. <em>Yes We Cannon</em> was a successful movement because as co-organizer Justin Jones points out, "we just put better information in front of them." <a class="ptr">[1]</a> Jones and team pointed out the benefits to the city as a whole, not just the privileged few on Twitter. They showed council that bike lanes are inclusive, allowing everyone access to safe and cost-effective transportation; people who cannot afford the high costs of a car, or who legally can't drive (adolescents and seniors) are all given access to a safe method of travel. They also highlighted several health benefits that protected bike lanes bring with them. The downtown casino, too, focused on community issues, citing the negative financial and social impacts for those living closest to the gambling facility, an area of Hamilton that is recognized as having a large contingent of low-income housing, higher crime rates, and joblessness. Even the <em>Dialogue Partners fiasco</em> arose out of frustration that the city was spending taxpayer money outside city limits rather than investing with local businesses and supporting local jobs. All of these issues gained support through Twitter and they all focused on the common good for the city—not on maintaining the privilege of the elites. </p>

<p>This group of well educated, high-income earning white Hamiltonians that make up most of Hamilton’s Twitter community may be privileged, but they are also engaged. They invest their time to become better educated on the topics being debated on Twitter and strive to make things better for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Perhaps it is their privilege that affords them the time to invest in these debates, while other less fortunate citizens struggle to earn a living wage. The Twitter population studied may sit higher on the socioeconomic ladder, but they fight for a better city for everyone.</p>

<h3>Further Research</h3>

<p>Researcher Jan van Djyk believes that there is some confusion about the digital divide, suggesting that the gap between the "haves" and "have nots" is difficult to bridge, and that the divide is about "absolute inequalities" between those individuals on each side of the divide. The digital divide involves more than just access to a computer and the Internet; social, psychological and cultural factors also contribute to the divide. This research did not have a scope large enough to include all such facets, which may contribute to a better understanding of the digital divide within the city of Hamilton—and how to overcome it so that less privileged voices can also be heard. </p>

<p>One question that was not considered for the survey was how many years respondents have lived in the city. During my research, there was a lot of anecdotal discussion about Twitter's use in facilitating community for newcomers to the city. Several people, myself included, had stories about using Twitter to learn about events, politics, and people in the their new city. As a 10-year resident of Hamilton, I began using Twitter in 2009 to help learn about the city, and as a result became civically engaged in the current political issues that affect the people of Hamilton. More information on the respondents, such as how long they have lived in the city may help to better explain the motives behind how and why they use Twitter for civic engagement and community building.</p>

<p>Slacktivism, in the case studies presented, has proven to be an effective method of activism, but its effectiveness was not compared to other forms of online civic engagement and activism. Studying slacktivism against other such methods such as hacktivism, online petitions, etc., would provide a better analysis of its true usefulness for change via the Internet.</p>

<p>Asking respondents about their political behaviour on Twitter in regard to a particular movement, rather than the general questions they were given, would have provided a clearer picture of slacktivsm in terms of Hamilton activism. For example, asking "Do you ever retweet material related to political or social issues on Twitter?" on a movement-by-movement basis would have provided a more macro-level discussion of slacktivism compared with the chosen method of asking the question as an overarching theme.</p>

<p>While this paper addresses some of the key themes affecting political discourse and community in Hamilton, an in-depth understanding of the individuals involved would further substantiate the findings of this research.</p>
